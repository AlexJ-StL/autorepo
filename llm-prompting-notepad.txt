Well, we need to make the changes that you suggest, so I think that we should just go down the list, make all the changes, and then go over the changes briefly at the ende all . So, we should start with 1. The scheduler UI needs better visual feedback when tasks are created/updated 2. The theme system could use specific styles for scheduler status indicators 3. We should add error recovery for failed schedule updates 4. The notification timing could be more flexible. So, please just proceed. There is no need for further confirmation until those 4 goals are reached. Then after those goals are accomplished we can move on to other things.

Good evening QwQ! I hope you are well. I look forward to working with you and your coding subordinate, Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct (who I will refer to as Qwen2.5-Coder as well). I am interested in having you plan how you want to accomplish the few goals I have for you and to add anything that you believe will make this application better. As for the coding any other work that you need to have done feel free to have your fellow Qwen model, Qwn2.5-Coder-32B, take care of it for you so that you can focus on planning, testing, ensure that the application functions without error and I am excited to see if you have anything unique that you would like to add which you believe would increase the application's usefulness, appearance, or novelty. With that out of the way, I have, just like in the past, included 3 documents to start our conversation this evening. #1) First, I have included autorepo-dir-tree.txt which is a directory tree of the files and subfolders of the project that we are working on. #2) Second, I have included 2024-11-26_2024-11-29-am - cline_chat_summary_no_code.md is the log of the last few times we worked on the project, but I removed the code because it would have overwhelmed your max token limit. #3) Lastly, I have included Automatic-Repo-Updater-Prompt.txt, which is the original prompt that we used to start this project. From those documents, and any other documents that you need I will provide for you upon request, I would like for you to: #1) Fully assess what we have accomplished so far. If there are any obvious errors, lets clean those up before we move on. #2) Determine what objectives we still have to accomplish along with any #a) features that you think that we should add to improve the application, #b) ensure that we had sufficient tests to ensure the application runs smoothly, and #c) ensure that there are no security vulnerabilities of any kind present. #3) Based on you assessment please put together a step-by-step plan to accomplish the remainder of the application. #Finishing_Remarks: I look forward to working with you on the remainder of this application and I know that you are fully capable of accomplishing all these tasks in a methodical step-by-step manner. Everyone recognizes your focus, knowledge, planning ability, and pleasant demeaner. If you have any questions or if you need anything please let me know and I will help with anything within my ability to accomplish the goal of finishing this application. Okay, team! Let's begin!  

Good evening! I hope that you are well. We have been working on a project together and I would like to take a little time to assess what we've done and set out a clear plan for where we are going. This evening I would like for you to assess the state of the application right now. To assist in that I have added a directory tree and the initial prompt. Based on the task and the documents provided, please feel free to ask to see any files necessary to complete the assessment. I would like for you to create either a .txt or .md file in the 'autorepo' directory titled "AutoRepo Completion Plan - 12-07-2024". The document will contain both your assessment summary and the step-by-step plan to finish this project. With that in mind, create the file, add your assessment of the application's current state, and then create a check list of tasks that need to be completed from todays date until the finish. The purpose of this assessment and check list is to help us, especially me, stay focused, organized, and allow for us to step away from this project and then jump back in without any, or at least very little, confusion or loss of efficiency. Thanks!
